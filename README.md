## üîß How to Set Up and Run

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone REPO_URL
cd ecommerce
```
### 2. Configure Database
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.

Update these fields in **application.yml**:

```yml
url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/ecommerce_db
username: postgres
password: 123456
```

### 3. Add Products to Database
Add products into the database, example script:
```sql
INSERT INTO products (id, name, description, price) VALUES
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Smartphone', 'Latest 5G smartphone with 128GB storage.', 699.99),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Laptop', 'Ultra-thin laptop with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD.', 1299.99),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Wireless Headphones', 'Noise-canceling wireless headphones.', 199.99),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Smartwatch', 'Waterproof smartwatch with heart rate monitor.', 249.99),
    (gen_random_uuid(), 'Gaming Console', 'Next-gen gaming console with 1TB storage.', 499.99);
```

### 4. Run the Application
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

**Note**: If you want to test payment redirection to success and error page, please deploy the app to an endpoint with https (we can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)) and change these URLs in `PaymentController.java`:
```java
body.put("return", "https://5d43-116-109-30-201.ngrok-free.app/payment/redirect");
body.put("callback", "https://5d43-116-109-30-201.ngrok-free.app/payment/callback")
```

##  üìå Usage
### 1. Access the Product List
- Navigate to /products
- Select products and quantities
- Proceed to the /create page

### 2. Create an Order
- Choose the shipping method (Delivery or Pickup)
- Proceed to /checkout for payment

### 3. Make Payment
- Enter your details (name, email, address)
- Complete payment via PayTabs iFrame

### 4. View Orders
- Access /orders to see all previous orders.
- Click an order to view payment and refund details.

## üîí Security Considerations
- Input Validation: Validates all user inputs before storing.
- UUID Usage: Uses secure UUIDs to prevent enumeration.
- Secure Payment Integration: Leverages PayTabs iFrame to avoid handling sensitive card information.
- Transaction Management: Ensures database consistency using @Transactional.
- Protected against SQL injection due to the use of Spring Data JPA and the Repository.

## Improvements
- Add Unit Tests.
- CORS Protection: Restricts access to known domains.
- Enhance error logging and monitoring.
